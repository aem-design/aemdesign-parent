MAC
===

Please read main readme before running these commands

### First Time Install

This section needs work

- Use a form of a [dev-setup](https://github.com/wildone/dev-setup) to get your Mac to a usable Dev state
- Install required software
- Please use standard bash on Mac because Zsh has a bug


# ZSH Bug
When running ```./devops``` in ZSH triggers unknown bug and causes ```.bash_profile``` to be filled with junk.
